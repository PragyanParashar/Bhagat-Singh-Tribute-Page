                <p> <b>Bhagat Singh,</b> (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab, India [now in
                    Pakistan]—died March 23, 1931,
                    Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement.</p>

                <p>Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform
                    sect of modern Hinduism), and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest
                    British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also worked
                    as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist
                    theories. He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the
                    revolution”).</p>

                <p>In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of Indian
                    writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a silent
                    march opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, junior officer J.P.
                    Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929 he and
                    an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the
                    implementation of the Defence of India Act and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for
                    the murder of Saunders.</p>
